## A fully functional Django Project, showing how to build your own Rest API 

This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube Series showing how to create a REST API. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Create a REST API using Django
* Create a python client that will emulate if another developer is trying to interact with our service
* Finally you are going to inegrate with a third party Rest API services, which is ALGOLIA
